# AccuKnox Dashboard

AccuKnox Dashboard is a dynamic and customizable dashboard application built using ReactJS, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Redux. The dashboard allows users to create, manage, and customize widgets within different categories, providing a flexible and interactive interface.

## Key Technologies

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For functionality and logic implementation.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Dashboard Creation**:
   - The dashboard is built dynamically using a JSON configuration.
   - The JSON structure contains categories, each with multiple widgets.

2. **Widget Management**:
   - Users can dynamically add or remove widgets within categories.
   - For each widget, users can input the widget name and text.

3. **Customizable Categories**:
   - Categories like "CSPM Executive Dashboard" can be created, with widgets assigned to them.
   - Users can add or remove widgets from categories easily.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can search through a list of all widgets, making it easier to find specific widgets within the dashboard.
